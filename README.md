MASON - Maya ASCII Scripted Object Notation  
  
About:  
Mason is a python package used to read/write Maya ASCII files.  
The codebase is currently in a relatively stable condition.  
There are some performance concerns when it comes to reading large files.  
As far as completion goes we're still missing support for the nurbsTrimfaces data type.
